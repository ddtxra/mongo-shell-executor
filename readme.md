# FastAPI with MongoDB and Authentication

This is a sample project that shows how to use FastAPI with MongoDB and authentication. It includes the following features:

- User authentication using JWT tokens
- Healthcheck endpoint to verify the application is running
- Authorization to ensure only authenticated users can execute queries
- A route to execute queries against a MongoDB instance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Docker (optional)

### Installing

To install the required dependencies, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

css
Copy code

### Configuration

The project requires a MongoDB instance to run. You can either use a local instance or run one using Docker:

docker run --name mongo -p 27017:27017 -d mongo

sql
Copy code

The project also requires a Keycloak server to handle user authentication. You can either use a local instance or run one using Docker:

docker run --name keycloak -p 8080:8080 -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -d quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:15.0.2

sql
Copy code

Once you have a MongoDB instance and Keycloak server running, update the configuration in `config.py` with the appropriate values.

### Running

To start the application, run:

uvicorn app.main:app --reload

csharp
Copy code

This will start the application on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Testing

To run the unit tests, run:

pytest

shell
Copy code

## Usage

### Healthcheck

To check if the application is running, navigate to:

http://localhost:8000/health

css
Copy code

### Authentication

To authenticate a user, navigate to:

http://localhost:8000/auth/token?username={username}&password={password}

css
Copy code

This will return a JWT token that can be used to execute queries against the MongoDB instance.

### Query Execution

To execute a query against the MongoDB instance, send a POST request to:

http://localhost:8000/query

csharp
Copy code

Include the query as a string in the request body:

{
"query": "db.collection.find()"
}

javascript
Copy code

Include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header:

Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
